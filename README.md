BlobeVM Installation Guide

STEP 1: ACCOUNT SETUP
Choose your preferred platform and create an account.

GitHub:
Sign up at https://github.com/join if you don't already have an account.

Gitpod (Recommended for Performance):
Go to https://gitpod.io/login, log in using GitHub, or create a new account.
Link LinkedIn for workspace integration by going to Settings > Integrations > LinkedIn.

Recommendation: Use Gitpod Large for optimal performance or GitHub Codespaces 4-core for a robust environment.

STEP 2: CREATE A WORKSPACE

Gitpod:
Log into Gitpod and create a workspace using the repository: https://github.com/coder0-code/BlobeVM.
Choose the "Large" plan for better speed and capacity.

GitHub Codespaces:
Visit https://github.com/codespaces/, select the BlobeVM repository, and create a codespace. When creating the codespace, ensure you select 4-core for performance.

STEP 3: INSTALL BLOBEVM

Open the terminal in your workspace or codespace and run:
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/coder0-code/BlobeVM/main/install.sh && chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh

STEP 4: FINALIZE SETUP

Follow the prompts in the installation script to complete the setup. Once installed, access BlobeVM directly in your browser.

RECOMMENDED CONFIGURATIONS:

For gaming: Use low-latency settings in BlobeVM's system preferences.
For multitasking: Large memory plans (Gitpod Large or Codespaces 4-core) ensure smoother Windows app and audio support.

Enjoy a seamless virtual machine experience with BlobeVM!
